// An IntervalGenerator is a function that takes the current Unix epoch time

// until the next request should be sent. Bender provides functions to create
// interval generators for uniform and exponential distributions, each of
// which takes the target throughput (requests per second) and returns an
// IntervalGenerator. Neither of the included generators makes use of the
// function argument, but it is there for cases in which the simulated
// intervals are time dependent (you want to simulate the daily traffice
// variation of a web site, for example).
