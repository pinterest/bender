# Bender DHCPv4 Tutorial

This tutorial walks through the steps to create a DHCPv4 load tester. Due to nature of the DHCP
protocol we cannot easily test standard queries made by users, but instead we may simulate a
clients sending queries that are forwarded by a Relay Agent. We won't cover setting up a DHCPv4
server and from this point we will assume you have a working server which can properly answer
RELAY queries. If you already know how to Go's DHCP libraries, skip to the "Load Testing" section
to get started with Bender and DHCPv4.

## Getting Started

You will need to install and configure Go by following the instructions on the
[Getting Started](https://golang.org/doc/install) page. Then follow the instructions on the
[How To Write Go Code](https://golang.org/doc/code.html) page, particularly for setting up your
workspace and the `GOPATH` environment variable, which we will use throughout this tutorial.

Next we need the DHCP library for Go, which you can fetch using `go get` as:
```sh
cd $GOPATH
go get -u github.com/insomniacslk/dhcp
```

Finally you will need the latest version of Bender, which you can get by running:

```sh
go get -u github.com/pinterest/bender
```

## Load Testing

The next few sections walk through the various parts of the load tester. If you are in a hurry skip
to the section "Final Load Tester Program" and just follow the instructions from there.

### Intervals

The first thing we need is a function to generate intervals (in nanoseconds) between executing
requests. The Bender library comes with some predefined intervals, including a uniform distribution
(always wait the same amount of time between each request) and an exponential distribution. In this
case we will use the exponential distribution, which means our server will experience load as
generated by a [Poisson process](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_process), which is fairly
typical of server workloads on the Internet (with the usual caveats that every service is a special
snowflake, etc, etc). We get the interval function with this code:

```go
intervals := bender.ExponentialIntervalGenerator(qps)
```

Where `qps` is our desired throughput measured in queries per second. It is also the reciprocal of
the mean value of the exponential distribution used to generate the request arrival times (see the
wikipedia article above). In practice this means you will see an average QPS that fluctuates around
the target QPS (with less fluctuation as you increase the time interval over which you are
averaging).

### Request Generator

The second thing we need is a channel of requests to send to the DHCPv4 server. When an interval
has been generated and Bender is ready to send the request, it pulls the next request from this
channel and spawns a goroutine to send the request to the server. This function creates a simple
synthetic request generator. We need to generate a DISCOVER requests and executor will take care
of adding RELAY properties:

```go
// HardwareAddr should return a random hardware address (we'll keep it simple)
func HardwareAddr() (net.HardwareAddr, error) {
	return net.ParseMAC("01:23:45:67:89:ab")
}

// SyntheticDHCPv4Requests generates up to n synthetic DHCPv4 requests
func SyntheticDHCPv4Requests(n int) chan interface{} {
	c := make(chan interface{}, n)
	go func() {
		for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
			// Generate "random" hardware address
			hw, err := HardwareAddr()
			if err != nil {
				log.Println("Error generating MAC:", err)
				continue
			}
			// Genereate Discover for the generated MAC address
			dis, err := dhcpv4.New()
			if err != nil {
				log.Println("Error generating DISCOVER:", err)
				continue
			}
			dis.SetHwType(iana.HwTypeEthernet)
			dis.SetHwAddrLen(uint8(len(hw)))
			dis.SetClientHwAddr(hw)
			dis.AddOption(&dhcpv4.OptMessageType{MessageType: dhcpv4.MessageTypeDiscover})
			c <- dis
		}
		close(c)
	}()
	return c
}
```

### Request Executor

The next thing we need is a request executor, which takes the requests generated above and sends
them to the service. We will use a helper function from Bender's dhcpv4 library to do most of the
work (connection management, error handling, etc), so all we have to do is write code to verify the
request. The executor will perform 4-way handshake (DISCOVER, OFFER, REQUEST, ACKNOWLEDGE) and the
validator will only be executed for a response after successfully processing all of them.

```go
func validator(req, res *dhcpv4.DHCPv4) error {
	return nil
}

exec := bdhcpv4.CreateExecutor(client, validator)
```

This validator accepts all requests which succeeded.

### Recorder

The last thing we need is a channel that will output events as the load tester runs. This will let
us listen to the load testers progress and record stats. We want this channel to be buffered so that
we can run somewhat independently of the load test without slowing it down:

```go
recorder := make(chan interface{}, 128)
```

The `LoadTestThroughput` function returns a channel on which it will send events for things like
the start of the load test, how long it waits between requests, how much overage it is currently
experiencing, and when requests start and end, how long they took and whether or not they had
errors. That raw event stream makes it possible to analyze the results of a load test. Bender has
a couple of simple "recorders" that provide basic functionality for result analysis and all of
which use the `Record` function:

* `NewLoggingRecorder` creates a recorder that takes a `log.Logger` and outputs each event to it in
a well-defined format.
* `NewHistogramRecorder` creates a recorder that manages a histogram of latencies from requests and
error counts.

You can combine recorders using the `Record` function, so you can both log events and manage a
histogram using code like this:

```go
l := log.New(os.Stdout, "", log.LstdFlags)
h := hist.NewHistogram(60000, 10000000)
bender.Record(recorder, bender.NewLoggingRecorder(l), bender.NewHistogramRecorder(h))
```

The histogram takes two arguments: the number of buckets and a scaling factor for times. In this
case we are going to record times in milliseconds and allow 60,000 buckets for times up to one
minute. The scaling factor is 1,000,000 which converts from nanoseconds (the timer values) to
milliseconds.

It is relatively easy to build recorders, or to just process the events from the channel yourself,
see the Bender documentation for more details on what events can be sent, and what data they
contain.

### Final Load Tester Program

Create a directory for the load tester:

```
mkdir -p src/$PKG/hellobender
```

Then create a file named `main.go` in that directory and add these lines to it:

```go
package main

import (
	"flag"
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"net"
	"os"
	"time"

	"github.com/insomniacslk/dhcp/dhcpv4"
	"github.com/insomniacslk/dhcp/dhcpv4/nclient4"
	"github.com/insomniacslk/dhcp/iana"
	"github.com/pinterest/bender"
	bdhcpv4 "github.com/pinterest/bender/dhcpv4"
	"github.com/pinterest/bender/hist"
)

// HardwareAddr should return a random hardware address (we'll keep it simple)
func HardwareAddr() (net.HardwareAddr, error) {
	return net.ParseMAC("01:23:45:67:89:ab")
}

// SyntheticDHCPv4Requests generates up to n synthetic DHCPv4 requests
func SyntheticDHCPv4Requests(n int) chan interface{} {
	c := make(chan interface{}, n)
	go func() {
		for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
			// Generate "random" hardware address
			hw, err := HardwareAddr()
			if err != nil {
				log.Println("Error generating MAC:", err)
				continue
			}
			// Genereate Discover for the generated MAC address
			dis, err := dhcpv4.New()
			if err != nil {
				log.Println("Error generating DISCOVER:", err)
				continue
			}
			dis.SetHwType(iana.HwTypeEthernet)
			dis.SetHwAddrLen(uint8(len(hw)))
			dis.SetClientHwAddr(hw)
			dis.AddOption(&dhcpv4.OptMessageType{MessageType: dhcpv4.MessageTypeDiscover})
			c <- dis
		}
		close(c)
	}()
	return c
}

func validator(req, res *dhcpv4.DHCPv4) error {
	return nil
}

var target = flag.String("target", "", "target DHCPv4 server")

func main() {
	flag.Parse()
	if *target == "" {
		log.Fatalln("You must specify target")
	}

	// Create client
	addr, err := net.ResolveUDPAddr("udp", net.JoinHostPort(*target, "67"))
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalln("Error resolving UDP:", err)
	}
	// We need to manually set the local address since we're using server port
	ip, err := getLocalIPv4("eth0")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalln("Error getting address:", err)
	}
	client, err := nclient4.New("eth0", nclient4.WithServerAddr(addr))
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalln("Error opening client:", err)
	}
	defer client.Close()

	// Load test
	intervals := bender.ExponentialIntervalGenerator(10)
	requests := SyntheticDHCPv4Requests(100)
	exec, err := bdhcpv4.CreateExecutor(client, ip, validator)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalln("Error creating executor:", err)
	}
	recorder := make(chan interface{}, 100)

	bender.LoadTestThroughput(intervals, requests, exec, recorder)

	l := log.New(os.Stdout, "", log.LstdFlags)
	h := hist.NewHistogram(60000, int(time.Millisecond))
	bender.Record(recorder, bender.NewLoggingRecorder(l), bender.NewHistogramRecorder(h))
	fmt.Println(h)
}

// getLocalIPv4 returns the interface local IPv4 address
func getLocalIPv4(ifname string) (net.IP, error) {
	iface, err := net.InterfaceByName(ifname)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}
	ifaddrs, err := iface.Addrs()
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}
	for _, ifaddr := range ifaddrs {
		if ipnet, ok := ifaddr.(*net.IPNet); ok {
			if ipnet.IP.To4() != nil && !ipnet.IP.IsLoopback() && !ipnet.IP.IsLinkLocalUnicast() {
				return ipnet.IP, nil
			}
		}
	}
	return nil, fmt.Errorf("no ipv4 address found for interface %s", ifname)
}
```

### Run the Load Tester

Run these commands to compile and install the load tester:

```sh
go install $PKG/hellobender
```

Because both server and load tester must run on port 67 it is not possible to run the test end the
server on the same machine. We will assume that your server is running on machine _example.com_.
Client takes ownership of port 67 so we need root access to run it:

```sh
sudo ./bin/hellobender -target example.com
```

You should see a long sequence of outputs and a final print out of the histogram data.
